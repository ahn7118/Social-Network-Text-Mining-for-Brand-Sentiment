# Social-Network-Text-Mining-for-Brand-Sentiment

## (1) Purpose of the Project

In this project, we aim to analyze consumer's sentiment toward brands based on opinions on social network such as twitter. Overall analysis is a replication of following thesis; Mohamed M. Mostafa (2013) "More than words: Social networks' text mining for consumer brand sentiments," *Expert Systems with Applications* 40, 4241-4251. 

In the original thesis, the author explained what is text analysis, various industrial fields that adopted sentiment analysis, and a method about how corporates could also use sentiment analysis and text mining for their marketing strategy. Among a number of chapters in the paper, main focus was to analysis sentiment score toward specific brand. Analyzing frequency word appeaarance, calculating sentiment scores, MDS(Multi Dimensional Scales),and data visualization for important brands were conducted for main focus in the paper.

I have added one more chapter in order to get this analysis further qualified. Hypothesis testing has been conducted so that readers could tell whether one brand's sentiment score is statiscally superior to another brand's sentiment score. This analysis result could provide a stepping stone for particular brand's marketing director.

Overall result summary for the report is going to be suggested in the last part of this project.
